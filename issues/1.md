### Proposal to Add UV Package Manager

This issue proposes to adopt the UV package manager as the default way of managing packages and running code in the repository. 

#### Benefits of Using UV:
- Streamlined package management
- Simplified project setup
- Consistency across development environments

#### Additionally:
- Include the `python-dotenv` package to load environment variables and secrets into the application seamlessly.

### Action Items:
1. Update documentation to reflect the changes.
2. Ensure that the `python-dotenv` package is added to the project requirements.
3. Verify that the setup process is clear and easy to follow.

Please discuss and provide feedback on this proposal!
